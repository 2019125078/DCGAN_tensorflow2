## Model
### DCGAN Guide
<center><img src="./images/dcgan_guide.png"></center>

* All models were trained with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a **mini-batch size of 128**. **All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02**. In the **LeakyReLU**, the slope of the leak was set to **0.2** in all models. While previous GAN work has used momentum to accelerate training, we used the **Adam optimizer** (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with tuned hyperparameters. We found the suggested **learning rate** of 0.001, to be too high, using **0.0002** instead. Additionally, we found leaving the **momentum term Î²1** at the suggested value of 0.9 resulted in training oscillation and instability while reducing it to **0.5** helped stabilize training.
